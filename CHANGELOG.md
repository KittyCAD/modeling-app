## [v0.22.7] - 2024-07-01

#### What's Changed

Most importantly the syntax for tags is now `$myTag` to declare a tag and `myTag` to then use it later. If you format your code via `Alt+Shift+F` or the three dot menu on the code panel it will fix this for you. We will keep backwards compatibility with string tags for a few releases but you should update your code now.

The nice thing about this is now the code editor autocompletes tag names for you and now you can get better errors when you abuse tags.

So for example this code:
```
const sketch001 = startSketchOn('XZ')
  |> startProfileAt([65.87, 230.28], %)
  |> line([248.25, -79.48], %)
  |> line([-74.04, -283.09], %, 'myTag')

## [v0.15.0] - 2024-02-17

- ✨ Features
  - Tangential Arcs in point-and-click and kcl
  - Try these out, they're working well in our testing!
  - Sketch on face in kcl
    - By tagging the segment that created a face in an extrude and referencing it later in your next sketch, you can place the new sketch on that face. We're so excited this works, and should be able to get it into the point-and-click interface soon.
  - Import in kcl
    - Currently only import non-kcl CAD files in your project directory like STEP at their original scale, at the origin. Lays the foundation for homogenous assemblies!
  - Linear and circular patterns in kcl
    - We are reworking implementation to allow for circular patterns to cut holes, expect more soon.
- 🍲 In-Progress Work
  - Foundations of ghost text for AI autocompletions
  - A new compiler for kcl called Grackle, which lays the foundation for batch command execution and big-time speedups
- 📉 Papercuts, Maintenance, & Bug Fixes
  - Stop backspace navigating back in history
  - Cmd + comma settings shortcut
  - Show app version in the settings
  - Link to kcl samples added to code menu
  - More robust testing so we can move faster
  - Update most dependencies
