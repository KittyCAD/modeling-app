## Kurt demo project

live at https://untitled-lang-git-main-kittycad.vercel.app/

Not sure what to call this, it's both a language/interpreter and a UI that uses the language as the source of truth model the user build with direct-manipulation with the UI.

It might make sense to split this repo up at some point, but not the lang and the UI are all togther in a react app
