## 1. Push a new tag

<details><summary>Instructions</summary><br>

Tag the repo on the latest main:

```
git tag $VERSION --message=""
git push origin $VERSION
```

This will trigger the `build-apps` workflow to set the version, build & sign the apps, and generate release files.

The workflow should be listed right away [in this list](https://github.com/KittyCAD/modeling-app/actions/workflows/build-apps.yml?query=event%3Apush).
Paste that link to that GitHub Actions run below.

Workflow run: ???

## 2. Manually test artifacts

<details><summary>Instructions</summary><br>

The release builds can be found under the `out-{arch}-{platform}` zip files, at the very bottom of the `build-apps` summary page for the workflow (triggered by the tag in step 1).

Assign someone to each section of the manual checklist.
