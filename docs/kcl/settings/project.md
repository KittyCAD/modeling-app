# Project Settings

Project specific settings for the app. These live in `project.toml` in the base of the project directory. Updating the settings for the project in the app will update this file automatically. Do not edit this file manually, as it may be overwritten by the app. Manual edits can cause corruption of the settings file.

## Project Configuration Structure

```toml
[settings.app]
# Set the appearance of the application
name = "My Awesome Project"

[settings.app.appearance]
# Use dark mode theme
theme = "dark" 
# Set the app color to blue (240.0 = blue, 0.0 = red, 120.0 = green)
color = 240.0

[settings.modeling]
# Use inches as the default measurement unit
base_unit = "in"

```
