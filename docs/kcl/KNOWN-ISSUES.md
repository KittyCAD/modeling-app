The following are bugs that are not in modeling-app or kcl itself. These bugs
once fixed in engine will just start working here with no language changes.

- **Sketch on Face**: If your sketch is outside the edges of the face (on which you
    are sketching) you will get multiple models returned instead of one single
    model for that sketch and its underlying 3D object.
    If you see a red line around your model, it means this is happening.

- **Import**: Right now you can import a file, even if that file has brep data
    you cannot edit it, after v1, the engine will account for this. You also cannot
    currently move or transform the imported objects at all, once we have assemblies
    this will work.

- **Fillets**: Fillets cannot intersect, you will get an error. Only simple fillet
    cases work currently.

- **Chamfers**: Chamfers cannot intersect, you will get an error. Only simple
    chamfer cases work currently.

    Sketching on the chamfered face does not currently work.
