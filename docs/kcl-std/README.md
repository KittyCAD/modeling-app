# Autogenerated docs

Everything in this directory and its subdirectories (except this file) is automatically generated. Do not edit anything in this directory directly, your changes will be lost.

The directory contents are generated by running the `test_generate_stdlib_markdown_docs` test in `/rust/kcl-lib/src/docs/gen_std_tests.rs`. Files are generated from the standard library declared in KCL (`/rust/kcl-lib/std`) and in Rust (`/rust/kcl-lib/src/std`), and by copying files from `../kcl-src`.
