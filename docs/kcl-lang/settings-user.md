# User Settings

User specific settings for the app. These live in `user.toml` in the app's configuration directory. Updating the settings in the app will update this file automatically. Do not edit this file manually, as it may be overwritten by the app. Manual edits can cause corruption of the settings file.

# Use dark mode theme
theme = "dark"
# Set the app color to blue (240.0 = blue, 0.0 = red, 120.0 = green)
color = 240.0

[settings.modeling]
# Use millimeters as the default measurement unit
base_unit = "mm"
