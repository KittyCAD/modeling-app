/// KCL types. This module contains fundamental types like `number`, `string`, `Solid`, and `Sketch`.

/// Types can (optionally) be used to describe a function's arguments and returned value. They are checked
/// when a program runs and can help avoid errors. They are also useful to help document what a function
/// does.

/// The `any` type is the type of all possible values in KCL. I.e., if a function accepts an argument
/// with type `any`, then it can accept any value.
///
/// ```kcl,norun
/// fn acceptAnything(@input: any) {
///   return true
/// }
///
/// acceptAnything(42)
/// acceptAnything('hello')
/// acceptAnything(XY)
/// acceptAnything([0, 1, 2])
/// ```

/// A number.
///
/// May be signed or unsigned, an integer or decimal value.
///
/// KCL numbers always include units, e.g., the number `42` is always '42 mm' or '42 degrees', etc.
/// it is never just '42'. The `number` type may or may not include units, if none are specified, then
/// it is the type of any number. E.g.,
///
/// - `number`: the type of any numbers,
/// - `number(mm)`: the type of numbers in millimeters,
/// - `number(in)`: the type of numbers in inches,
/// - `number(Length)`: the type of numbers in any length unit,
/// - `number(deg)`: the type of numbers in degrees,
/// - `number(Angle)`: the type of numbers in any angle unit,
/// - `number(_)` or `number(Count)`: the type of unit-less numbers, representing a count of things,
/// or a ratio, etc.
///
/// For more information, see [numeric types](/docs/kcl-lang/numeric).

/// Tags are used to give a name (tag) to a specific path.
///
/// ### Tag Declaration
///
/// The syntax for declaring a tag is `$myTag` you would use it in the following
/// way:
///
/// ```norun,inline
/// startSketchOn(XZ)
///   |> startProfile(at = origin)
///   |> angledLine(angle = 0, length = 191.26, tag = $rectangleSegmentA001)
///   |> angledLine(
///        angle = segAng(rectangleSegmentA001) - 90,
///        length = 196.99,
///        tag = $rectangleSegmentB001,
///      )
///   |> angledLine(
///        angle = segAng(rectangleSegmentA001),
///        length = -segLen(rectangleSegmentA001),
///        tag = $rectangleSegmentC001,
///      )
///   |> line(endAbsolute = [profileStartX(%), profileStartY(%)])
///   |> close()
/// ```
///
/// ### Tag Identifier
///
/// As per the example above you can use the tag identifier to get a reference to the 
/// tagged object. The syntax for this is `myTag`.
/// 
/// In the example above we use the tag identifier to get the angle of the segment
/// `segAng(rectangleSegmentA001)`.
///
/// ### Tag Scope
///
/// Tags are scoped globally if in the root context meaning in this example you can 
/// use the tag `rectangleSegmentA001` in any function or expression in the file.
///
/// However if the code was written like this:
///
/// ```norun,inline
/// fn rect(origin) {
///   return startSketchOn(XZ)
///     |> startProfile(at = origin)
///     |> angledLine(angle = 0, length = 191.26, tag = $rectangleSegmentA001)
///     |> angledLine(
///          angle = segAng(rectangleSegmentA001) - 90,
///          length = 196.99,
///          tag = $rectangleSegmentB001)
///     |> angledLine(
///          angle = segAng(rectangleSegmentA001),
///          length = -segLen(rectangleSegmentA001),
///          tag = $rectangleSegmentC001
///        )
///     |> line(endAbsolute = [profileStartX(%), profileStartY(%)])
///     |> close()
/// }
/// 
/// rect(origin = [0, 0])
/// rect(origin = [20, 0])
/// ```
///
/// Those tags would only be available in the `rect` function and not globally.
///
/// However you likely want to use those tags somewhere outside the `rect` function.
///
/// Tags are accessible through the sketch group they are declared in.
/// For example the following code works.
///
/// ```norun,inline
/// fn rect(origin) {
///   return startSketchOn(XZ)
///     |> startProfile(at = origin)
///     |> angledLine(angle = 0, length = 191.26, tag = $rectangleSegmentA001)
///     |> angledLine(
///          angle = segAng(rectangleSegmentA001) - 90,
///          length = 196.99
///          tag = $rectangleSegmentB001,
///        )
///     |> angledLine(
///          angle = segAng(rectangleSegmentA001),
///          length = -segLen(rectangleSegmentA001)
///          tag = $rectangleSegmentC001,
///        )
///     |> line(endAbsolute = [profileStartX(%), profileStartY(%)])
///     |> close()
/// }
/// 
/// rect(origin = [0, 0])
/// myRect = rect(origin = [20, 0])
/// 
/// myRect
///   |> extrude(length = 10)
///   |> fillet(radius = 0.5, tags = [myRect.tags.rectangleSegmentA001])
/// ```
///
/// See how we use the tag `rectangleSegmentA001` in the `fillet` function outside
/// the `rect` function. This is because the `rect` function is returning the
/// sketch group that contains the tags.

/// An abstract plane.
///
/// A plane has a position and orientation in space defined by its origin and axes. A plane is abstract
/// in the sense that it is not part of the objects being drawn. A plane can be used to sketch on.
///
/// A plane can be created in several ways:
/// - you can use one of the default planes, e.g., `XY`.
/// - you can use `offsetPlane` to create a new plane offset from an existing one, e.g., `offsetPlane(XY, offset = 150)`.
/// - you can use negation to create a plane from an existing one which is identical but has an opposite normal
/// e.g., `-XY`.
/// - you can define an entirely custom plane, e.g.,
///
/// ```kcl,inline,norun
/// myXY = {
///   origin = { x = 0, y = 0, z = 0 },
///   xAxis = { x = 1, y = 0, z = 0 },
///   yAxis = { x = 0, y = 1, z = 0 },

///     |> line(end = [24, 0])
///     |> line(end = [0, -24])
///     |> line(end = [-24, 0])
///     |> close()
/// ```
///
/// The `mySketch` variable will be an executed `Sketch` object. Executed being past
/// tense, because the engine has already executed the commands to create the sketch.
///
/// The previous sketch commands will never be executed again, in this case.
///
/// If you would like to encapsulate the commands to create the sketch any time you call it,
/// you can use a function.
///
/// ```kcl,inline
/// fn createSketch() {
///    return startSketchOn(XY)
///         |> startProfile(at = [-12, 12])
///         |> line(end = [24, 0])

///         |> line(end = [-24, 0])
///         |> close()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Now, every time you call `createSketch()`, the commands will be
/// executed and a new sketch will be created.
///
/// When you assign the result of `createSketch()` to a variable (`mySketch = createSketch()`), you are assigning
/// the executed sketch to that variable. Meaning that the sketch `mySketch` will not be executed
/// again.

/// the sketch will be updated.
