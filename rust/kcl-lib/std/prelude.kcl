/// Tags are used to give a name (tag) to a specific path.
///
/// ### Tag Declaration
///
/// The syntax for declaring a tag is `$myTag` you would use it in the following
/// way:
///
/// ```norun,inline
/// startSketchOn('XZ')
///   |> startProfileAt(origin, %)
///   |> angledLine({angle = 0, length = 191.26}, %, $rectangleSegmentA001)
///   |> angledLine({
///        angle = segAng(rectangleSegmentA001) - 90,
///        length = 196.99,
///      }, %, $rectangleSegmentB001)
///   |> angledLine({
///        angle = segAng(rectangleSegmentA001),
///        length = -segLen(rectangleSegmentA001),
///      }, %, $rectangleSegmentC001)
///   |> line(endAbsolute = [profileStartX(%), profileStartY(%)])
///   |> close()
/// ```
///
/// ### Tag Identifier
///
/// As per the example above you can use the tag identifier to get a reference to the 
/// tagged object. The syntax for this is `myTag`.
/// 
/// In the example above we use the tag identifier to get the angle of the segment
/// `segAng(rectangleSegmentA001, %)`.
///
/// ### Tag Scope
///
/// Tags are scoped globally if in the root context meaning in this example you can 
/// use the tag `rectangleSegmentA001` in any function or expression in the file.
///
/// However if the code was written like this:
///
/// ```norun,inline
/// fn rect(origin) {
///   return startSketchOn('XZ')
///     |> startProfileAt(origin, %)
///     |> angledLine({angle = 0, length = 191.26}, %, $rectangleSegmentA001)
///     |> angledLine({
///          angle = segAng(rectangleSegmentA001) - 90,
///          length = 196.99
///        }, %, $rectangleSegmentB001)
///     |> angledLine({
///          angle = segAng(rectangleSegmentA001),
///          length = -segLen(rectangleSegmentA001)
///        }, %, $rectangleSegmentC001)
///     |> line(endAbsolute = [profileStartX(%), profileStartY(%)])
///     |> close()
/// }
/// 
/// rect([0, 0])
/// rect([20, 0])
/// ```
///
/// Those tags would only be available in the `rect` function and not globally.
///
/// However you likely want to use those tags somewhere outside the `rect` function.
///
/// Tags are accessible through the sketch group they are declared in.
/// For example the following code works.
///
/// ```norun,inline
/// fn rect(origin) {
///   return startSketchOn('XZ')
///     |> startProfileAt(origin, %)
///     |> angledLine({angle = 0, length = 191.26}, %, $rectangleSegmentA001)
///     |> angledLine({
///          angle = segAng(rectangleSegmentA001) - 90,
///          length = 196.99
///        }, %, $rectangleSegmentB001)
///     |> angledLine({
///          angle = segAng(rectangleSegmentA001),
///          length = -segLen(rectangleSegmentA001)
///        }, %, $rectangleSegmentC001)
///     |> line(endAbsolute = [profileStartX(%), profileStartY(%)])
///     |> close()
/// }
/// 
/// rect([0, 0])
/// myRect = rect([20, 0])
/// 
/// myRect
///   |> extrude(10, %)
///   |> fillet(
///        radius = 0.5,
///        tags = [myRect.tags.rectangleSegmentA001]
///      )
/// ```
///
/// See how we use the tag `rectangleSegmentA001` in the `fillet` function outside
/// the `rect` function. This is because the `rect` function is returning the
/// sketch group that contains the tags.

/// tense, because the engine has already executed the commands to create the sketch.
///

///

/// executed and a new sketch will be created.

/// the executed sketch to that variable. Meaning that the sketch `mySketch` will not be executed
