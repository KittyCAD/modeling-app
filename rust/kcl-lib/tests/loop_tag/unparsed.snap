// This is a performance regression test. There was previously some O(2^numSides) nonsense
// in updating tags. If this test stops terminating in reasonable time, or versions of tags
// explodes in program memory, then you might want to look at how tag infos are being merged
// by `update_memory_for_tags_of_geometry`.
