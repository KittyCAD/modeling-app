These are principles we try to follow as a team working on this product. Anyone can suggest additions or edits. 

## 0. Application architecture
1. Use React as a thin view layer unless absolutely necessary, presenting state that is defined outside of React.

## 1. UX design
1. Animate sparingly
2. Keep distractions from the scene at a minimum
