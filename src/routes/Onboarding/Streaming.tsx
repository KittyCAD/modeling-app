            Historically, CAD programs run on your computer, so to run
            performance-heavy apps you have to have a powerful, expensive
            desktop. But the 3D scene you see here is not running on your
            computer.

            Instead, our infrastructure spins up our Geometry Engine on a remote
            GPU, Modeling App sends it a series of commands{' '}

            This means that you could run our Modeling App on nearly any device
            with a good internet connection.

          <p className="my-4">
            It also means that whatever tools you build on top of our Geometry
            Engine will be able to run on any device with a browser, and you
            won't have to worry about the performance of the device.
