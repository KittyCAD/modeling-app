            kcl is our language for describing geometry. Building our own
            language is difficult, but we chose to do it to have a language
            honed for spatial relationships and geometric computation. It'll
            always be open-source, and we hope it can grow into a new standard
            for describing parametric objects.

            The left pane is where you write your code. It's a code editor with
            syntax highlighting and autocompletion for kcl. New features arrive
            in kcl before they're available as point-and-click tools, so it's
            good to have a link to{' '}
