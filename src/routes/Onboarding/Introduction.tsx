            Welcome to {APP_NAME}! This is a hardware design tool that lets you
            edit visually, with code, or both. It's powered by the KittyCAD
            Design API, the first API created for anyone to build hardware
            design tools. The 3D view is not running on your computer, but is
            instead being streamed to you from an instance of our Geometry
            Engine on a remote GPU as video.

            As you go through the onboarding, we'll be changing and resetting
            your code occasionally, so that we can reference specific code
            features. So hold off on writing production KCL code until you're
            done with the onboarding ðŸ˜‰
