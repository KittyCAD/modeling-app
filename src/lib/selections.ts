/*
How selections work is complex due to the nature that we rely on the engine
to tell what has been selected after we send a click command. But than the
app needs these selections to be based on cursors, therefore the app must
be in control of selections. On top of that because we need to set cursor
positions in code-mirror for selections, both from app logic, and still
allow the user to add multiple cursors like a normal editor, it's best to
let code mirror control cursor positions and associate those source ranges
with entity ids from code-mirror events later.

So it's a lot of back and forth. conceptually the back and forth is:

1) we send a click command to the engine
2) the engine sends back ids of entities that were clicked
3) we associate that source ranges with those ids
4) we set the codemirror selection based on those source ranges (taking
  into account if the user is holding shift to add to current selections
  or not). we also create and remember a SelectionRangeTypeMap
5) Code mirror fires a an event that cursors have changed, we loop through
  these ranges and associate them with entity ids again with the ArtifactMap,
  but also we can pick up selection types using the SelectionRangeTypeMap
6) we clear all previous selections in the engine and set the new ones

The above is less likely to get stale but below is some more details,
because this wonders all over the code-base, I've tried to centeralise it
by putting relevant utils in this file. All of the functions below are
pure with the exception of getEventForSelectWithPoint which makes a call
to the engine, but it's a query call (not mutation) so I'm okay with this.
Actual side effects that change cursors or tell the engine what's selected
are still done throughout the in their relevant parts in the codebase.

In detail:

1) Click commands are mostly sent in stream.tsx search for
  "select_with_point"
2) The handler for when the engine sends back entity ids calls
  getEventForSelectWithPoint, it fires an XState event to update our
  selections is xstate context
3 and 4) The XState handler for the above uses handleSelectionBatch and
  handleSelectionWithShift to update the selections in xstate context as
  well as returning our SelectionRangeTypeMap and a codeMirror specific
  event to be dispatched.
5) The codeMirror handler for changes to the cursor uses
  processCodeMirrorRanges to associate the ranges back with their original
  types and the entity ids (the id can vary depending on the type, as
  there's only one source range for a given segment, but depending on if
  the user selected the segment directly or the vertex, the id will be
  different)
6) We take all of the ids and create events for the engine with
  resetAndSetEngineEntitySelectionCmds

An important note is that if a user changes the cursor directly themselves
then they skip directly to step 5, And these selections get a type of
"default".

There are a few more nuances than this, but best to find them in the code.
