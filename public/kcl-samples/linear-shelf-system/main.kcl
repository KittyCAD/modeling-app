// Linear Shelf System
// A parametric, horizontally stackable shelf system for furniture layout and prototyping.


// This model generates a configurable number of narrow shelf units arranged side-by-side.
// Each unit includes:
// - Two vertical side panels
// - A floor plinth with toe kick
// - Multiple evenly spaced shelves (with optional top cover)
// All geometric parameters (unit width, height, depth, shelf count, spacing, and material thickness)
// are customizable, allowing for rapid iteration of layout concepts such as storage walls,
// room dividers, or library-style shelving.
// Designed for clean stacking, clarity in construction, and modular expansion.
