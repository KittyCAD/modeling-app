// Scrub Daddy Sponge Holder
// A scrub daddy is a sponge with a course texture which has the shape of a smiling face. This holder attaches magnetically to the wall of your sink or other locations where a sponge may be needed. The holder is designed to fit through the eye openings on the sponge. This is designed to fit mangets with a diameter of 6mm and thickness of 3 mm.
