// Parametric Shelf Unit
// A modular and adjustable 3D shelf model designed for basic furniture design.


// This model includes:
// - Two vertical side panels (left and right)
// - A floor base (spacer) at the bottom
// - Multiple evenly spaced horizontal shelf boards
// - Optional top board acting as a cover
// All elements are parametric and adaptable through clearly named variables.
